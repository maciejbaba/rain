# rain

Demo => https://maciek367.github.io/rain/

I needed somekind of animation for second monitor when I don't use it, so I created simple pixel rain

It's made using HTML canvas, 2d graphics and Typescript

In this project I practiced mainly Typescript, hardest part was to get right types in order for functions and objects to work but if you set it up correctly it makes your code very clear and incredibly comfortable to work with.

Also I tried to have every part of my code as readable as I could. Additionally tried to keep my functions reusable and separated.

If you read this, I hope you are having a nice day (or night) :)
