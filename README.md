# rain

Demo => https://maciek367.github.io/rain/

I needed somekind of animation for second screen when I play game on first one, so I created simple pixel rain without any tutorial

It's made using HTML canvas element, 2d graphics and Typescript

In this project I practiced mainly Typescript, hardest part was to get right types in order for functions and objects to work but if you set it up correctly it makes your code very clear and incredibly comfortable to work with.

Also I tried to have every part of my code as readable as I could. Additionally tried to keep my functions reusable and separated.

If you read this, I hope you are having a nice day (or night) :)
